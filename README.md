### Inspiration
My first venture into Java programming led me to create the Simple Java Calculator. The inspiration was to grasp the basics of user input, decision-making, and arithmetic operations while building a functional and straightforward application.

### What it does
The Simple Java Calculator is a console-based program designed to perform basic arithmetic calculations. Users can input two numbers and choose from operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It's a beginner-friendly tool for understanding fundamental Java concepts.

### How we built it
Built entirely in Java, this project utilized basic input/output functions and conditional statements. I followed step-by-step tutorials to understand user input, handle decisions, and implement mathematical operations. No fancy frameworks or advanced concepts—just the essentials for a beginner's first project.

### Challenges we ran into
As a beginner, I faced challenges in handling user input and managing different scenarios, especially when it came to preventing division by zero. Debugging and understanding error messages were part of the learning curve.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
The successful creation of a working Simple Java Calculator marks a significant achievement. I'm proud to have implemented a functional program that performs arithmetic operations based on user input.

### What we learned
This project taught me the basics of Java programming, including variables, user input, conditionals, and simple algorithms. Understanding how to structure code for a small application laid a solid foundation for future learning.

### What's next for Simple Java Calculator
As a first Java project, the next steps involve exploring more complex projects, perhaps with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) or incorporating additional features like memory functions. This project serves as a stepping stone for further Java exploration and skill development.
